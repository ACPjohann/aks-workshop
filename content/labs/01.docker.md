# Hands-on Lab - Day 1 
## Exercise 1 - Understanding docker commands

In this exercise you will pull a couple of Docker images and run them as containers.

The first image will be Nginx. Nginx is a free open-source web server, that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache.

The second one will be Apache Tomcat, which is also an open source implementation of  Java Serverlet and Java Server Pages technologies. 

#### Task 1 - Download the nginx image 
```
docker pull nginx
```
#### Task 2 - Check that you have the image locally
```
docker images
```
#### Task 3 - Run a container with the nginx image
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mynginx nginx
```
#### Task 4 - Check your container is running
With your browser go to the ip address of your VM and check port 8080
```
http://<ip address of your VM>:8080
```

#### Task 5 - Check your container is running
```
docker ps -a
```
#### Task 6 - Stop the nginx container (mynginx)
```
docker stop mynginx
```

#### Task 7 - Run Tomcat 8.0 (interactively)
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 tomcat:8.0
```
Note that this time your container is running interactively. If you want to stop it press Ctrl+C

#### Task 8 - Check that Tomcat is running 
With your browser go to the ip address of your VM using port 8080

#### Task 9 - Remove all your containers 
```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
## Exercise 2 - How to Containerize and application

In the second exercise you will create a new application. First you will run the application locally, with no containers to ensure that your applications is working. After that you will create an image that includes your application. 

#### Task 1 - Clone a sample application
```
git clone https://github.com/carlosalexei/demoapps.git
```

#### Task 2 - Explore the application 
```
cd demoapps/HelloWorld
```
Take a moment to check this is a simple MVC .NET application
#### Task 3 - Check the Dockerfile file
```Dockerfile
# Define base image that includes dev tools
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 as DevEnv

# Create a folder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project file
COPY *.csproj ./

# Restore dotnet libraries for the project
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy all application files
COPY . ./

# Compile project and create production binaries
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/out

# Download another images with aspnet runtime
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet

# Copy from the first image (DevEnv) binaries
COPY --from=DevEnv /app/out .

# Define the process to be executed in the container
ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "HelloWorld.dll" ]
```

#### Task 4 - Build the image
```
docker build -t helloworld:1.0 .
```


#### Task 5 - Run the container
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 helloworld:1.0
```
#### Task 6 - Run the container
Go to https://hub.docker.com and Sign up to have your image repository there.


#### Task 7 - Tag your image 
```
docker tag helloworld:1.0 <<your account>>/helloworld:1.0
```
e.g. 
docker tag helloworld:1.0 carlosalexei/helloworld:1.0
